        <h1>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam: The people's president and
            visinory scientist.

        </h1>
        <big>
            Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, popularly known as APJ Abdul Kalam,
            was a distinguished Indian scientist, the 11th President of India, and a beloved 
            teacher. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Dr. Kalam's life 
            journey from a humble background to becoming a pivotal figure in India's 
            scientific and political spheres is an inspiring tale of dedication, perseverance, 
            and visinory.

            Kalam describes a "transformative moment" in his life when he asked Pramukh Swami, 
            the guru of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sampradaya, how India might realise this five-pronged 
            vision of development.

            Pramukh Swami's answer—to add a sixth area developing faith in God 
            and spirituality to overcome the current climate of crime and corruption—became the 
            spiritual vision for the next 15 years Kalam's life, which he describes in his final book, 
            Transcendence: My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh Swamiji, published just a month before 
            his death.

            It was reported that there was considerable demand in South Korea for translated versions 
            of books 
            authored by him.

            Kalam took an active interest in other developments in the field of science and 
            technology, including a research programme for developing biomedical implants. 
            He also supported open source technology over proprietary software, predicting 
            that the use of free software on a large scale would bring the benefits of 
            information technology to more people.

            Kalam set a target of interacting with 100,000 students during the two years 
            after his resignation from the post of scientific adviser in 1999. 
            
            
            He explained, "I feel comfortable in the company of young people, particularly 
            high school students. Henceforth, I intend to share with them experiences, 
            helping them to ignite their imagination and preparing them to work for a 
            developed India for which the road map is already available." His dream is to let 
            every student to light up the sky with victory using their latent fire in heart.

        <big>Dr. Kalam was born into a modest family, where his father was a boat owner and
            his mother a homemaker. Despite financial constraints, Kalam's<br> parents were
            supportive of his education. 
            Kalam's early schooling was at the Schwartz Higher 
            Secondary School in Ramanathapuram.<br> He was an average student but was known for 
            his curiosity and thirst for knowledge. His interest in flying led him to pursue 
            a degree in<br> aerospace engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology (MIT).

                Establishment of the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO). 
                However, his major contributions came during his tenure at the Indian Space 
                Research Organization (ISRO). As the project director of India's first 
                Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III), he played a crucial role in successfully 
                deploying the Rohini satellite in near-Earth orbit in 1980. This achievement 
                marked India's entry into the space club.Later, as the Chief Scientific 
                Adviser to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the DRDO, Dr. Kalam 
                spearheaded the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, which showcased India's 
                nuclear capabilities to the world. His work in the development of ballistic 
                missile technology earned him the moniker "Missile Man of India." Dr. Kalam's 
                vision was not limited to advancements in defense; he also advocated for the 
                use of technology to improve the lives of ordinary citizens, emphasizing 
                rural development, healthcare, and education.
